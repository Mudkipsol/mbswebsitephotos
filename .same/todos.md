# MBS Roofing Website Development Todos

## âœ… **TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### âœ… **TASK 1 - Subcategory Images Clickable (VERIFIED)**
âœ… Verified that subcategory images are already clickable in Shingles and Hip & Ridge views
âœ… Image clicks navigate to the exact same URL as "Select Colors" button
âœ… Both use `navigateToProduct(product.id)` function - already implemented correctly
âœ… No changes needed - existing functionality works as requested

### âœ… **TASK 2 - Product Listing Layout Reverted (COMPLETED)**
âœ… Reverted colors/variants view to original "good" layout
âœ… Replaced simple color swatches with full product cards
âœ… Each color now displays as complete product card with:
  - Product image with stock badge and color indicator
  - Product title (e.g., "Landmark - Moire Black")
  - Brand name (e.g., "CertainTeed")
  - Description text ("CertainTeed Landmark Architectural Shingle")
  - SKU line (e.g., "SKU: LANDMARK-CHARCOAL-BLACK")
  - Price with unit ("$130 / Square")
  - Quantity controls (minus, input, plus buttons)
  - View Details button
  - Add to Cart button
âœ… Proper spacing and typography matching reference design
âœ… Grid layout: 3 columns on large screens, responsive
âœ… Removed old separate "Add to Cart" section
âœ… Integrated functionality into each individual card
